# WyRm
The devolved Snake game we all wish I hadn't made

## What is WyRm?
It's a really crappy game. It's even more crappily coded. I'm trying to fix both
of these. The first bit is probably here to stay, but the second bit can be
improved. 

## Why should I play WyRm?
Honestly, you shouldn't

## Ben, I haven't read any of the things above this. How do I install?
1. Download this
2. Install pygame (`sudo apt-get install python-pygame` or `pip install pygame`
   should do the trick)
3. Give away your computer because you've ruined it
4. Never speak of this again

## Ben, I really don't like your game.
Dude, I warned you.

## Ben, you're too hard on yourself. This is a great game!!
Thank you so much, Ben, it's so nice to finally get some good feedback, even if
it is from myself.
